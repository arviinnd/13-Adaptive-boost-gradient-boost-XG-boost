Subject: use case on loan approval or denial status using adaptive boosting, xg boost and gradient boosting <br>
<br>
Respected everyone, <br>
<br>
The aim of this case study is to predict the loan approval or denial status of an applicant using adaptive boosting, XG boost and 
gradient boosting algorithms. First we load the dataset and the libraries into the code. We then carry out data exploration activities 
like taking a peek at the data, studying descriptive statistics, class distributions and correlation between attributes. We further 
explore the data and then carry out data visualization using univariate (histogram, density and box and whisker) plots and multivariate 
(scatter plot matrix and correlation matrix) plots. We then split the data into train and test data and then instantiate models using 
Adaptive boosting, XG boost and gradient boosting . Then the models are fitted and the acuracy is found out. We predict the values and 
plot the confusion matrix. The models give accuracies of 87%, 87% and 88 % respectively.
